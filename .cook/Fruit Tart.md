5. Take off heat. Add rum and butter.
6. Strain and give ice bath*.
7. Put in fridge. Cover with wrap (should be on the surface of the cream).

## Crust Steps

1. Combine flour, sugar, and salt. Mix in butter till crumbly.
2. Mix in egg (will not mix evenly)
3. Press into tart pan. Build walls around the edges.
4. Bake for 20 minutes at 410ÂºF.

## Notes

1. Separate egg yolks with yo hands. Egg whites are sterile but yolks are not. Use yolks immediately or put in fridge. Egg whites may be frozen (cover the surface to avoid skin?).
2. Ice bath is not necessary.
3. Glaze the fruits with a warm mix of jam and water for a more professional look.
