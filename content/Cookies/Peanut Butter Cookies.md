From *The Perfect Cookie* by America's Test Kitchen

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 1/2 cups (12 1/2oz) flour
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda
- [ ] (optional) 1 cup salted dry-roasted peanuts
- [ ] 16 tbsp softened, butter
- [ ] 1 cup packed (7oz) light brown sugar
- [ ] 1 cup (7oz) sugar
- [ ] 1 cup (10oz) extra-crunchy peanut butter
- [ ] 2 tsp vanilla
- [ ] 2 large eggs

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Pulse peanuts in food processor to fine crumbs (~14 pulses)
3. Using stand mixer with paddle, beat butter, sugar, and brown sugar on medium till pale and fluffy (~3 mins). Add peanut butter until fully incorporated (~30 secs). Add vanilla and eggs. Reduce to low speed and slowly add dry mixture (~30 secs). Mix in ground peanuts till incorporated.
4. Roll out 25g balls and place 2 inches a part on baking sheet. Make crosshatch using fork (dip fork in sugar to prevent sticking).
5. Bake for 10 minutes, till edges are golden and center puffed but beginning to deflate (will seem raw but they just need time to cool). Switch sheet and rotate halfway through. Let cookies cool for 10 minutes.

## Notes

Raw dough can be frozen for a month. Bake at 300 degrees for 17-22 minutes.
