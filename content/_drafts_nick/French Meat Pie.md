# [French Meat Pie](https://www.yummly.com/recipe/French-Meat-Pie-9207327?prm-v1#directions)

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 pounds ground pork
- [ ] 2 pounds ground beef (round)
- [ ] ¾ cup finely diced celery
- [ ] 1 yellow onion, finely diced
- [ ] 5 cups hot water
- [ ] 2 teaspoons Better Than Bouillon chicken base
- [ ] 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- [ ] 2 cups seasoned breadcrumbs
- [ ] ½ teaspoon allspice
- [ ] ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- [ ] salt and black pepper to taste
- [ ] 2 Homemade or store bought pie crust (for 9-inch pies

## Procedure

1. Dissolve the Better Than Bouillon chicken into the hot water. Set aside.

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, over medium heat. Cook the onion and celery for about 5 minutes to slightly soften. Stir with a wooden spoon to not burn.

1. Add the chicken stock mixture, ground pork, ground beef, and poultry seasoning. Cook over medium heat until the meat is cooked, about 20 minutes.

1. Add the breadcrumbs, allspice, ground cloves, and black pepper. Stir to combine. Let cook another 10 minutes.

1. Add salt to taste. Should only need a pinch of salt. (remember bouillon and breadcrumbs already have salt in them)

1. Let cool completely. Add to unbaked pie shells. Either homemade pie crust or store-bought. Top with pie crust. Roll edges under and pinch around the entire pie. Use a sharp knife to slice a slit in the top of each pie.

1. Brush with egg wash. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven until the crust is nicely browned. About 30 to 45 minutes.

## Notes

- Ask your butcher to double or triple grind the pork and beef.
- You can add 1 or 2 cups of mashed potatoes or small diced cooked potatoes to this meat stuffing.
- You will not be browning the meat! It simply cooks in the liquid.
- Cool completely before adding to an unbaked pie shell!
