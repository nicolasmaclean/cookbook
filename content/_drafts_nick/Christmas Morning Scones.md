# [Christmas Morning Scones](https://www.anediblemosaic.com/christmas-morning-scones-aka-vanilla-bean-nutmeg-and-rosemary-scented-scones/)

## Ingredients

- [ ] 312.5 g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 72 g granulated sugar
- [ ] 12 g baking powder
- [ ] 4.5 g salt
- [ ] 1 g fresh-grated whole nutmeg
- [ ] 30 g unsweetened dried cranberries, chopped small
- [ ] 0.4 g minced fresh rosemary
- [ ] 84 g unsalted butter chilled and diced
- [ ] 242 g half and half (can sub with whole milk or cream)
- [ ] 5 g vanilla bean paste
- [ ] 7.5 g whole milk for brushing on top

## Glaze Ingredients

- [ ] 120 g powdered sugar
- [ ] 2.5 g vanilla bean paste
- [ ] 0.5 g fresh-grated whole nutmeg
- [ ] 30 g water

## Procedure

1. Preheat oven to 450F. Line a baking sheet with a silpat liner for easy cleanup; otherwise, lightly grease a baking sheet.
1. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, dried cranberries, and rosemary in a large bowl.
1. Cut in the butter with a fork or using two butter knives until it looks like coarse meal. Stir in the half and half and vanilla bean paste. (The dough should come together, but not be too wet.)
1. Shape the dough into a ball, then flatten it into a disk; wrap it in plastic wrap and chill 10 minutes in the freezer.
1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll or press the dough out to a circle about 7 to 8 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick. Cut the circle of dough into 8 equal wedges.
1. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet, lightly brush the tops with a little milk, and bake until puffed and light golden brown on top and bottom, about 14 to 16 minutes. Cool completely.
1. Once cooled, whisk together all ingredients for the glaze. Dip the tops of the scones into the glaze, letting it run down the sides; sprinkle a few dried cranberries and rosemary leaves on top, if desired. Place the scones onto a wire rack and let the glaze set completely before serving.
