## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 block (14 oz) extra-firm tofu
- [ ] 1 sheet nori (optional)
- [ ] 1/3 cup cornstarch
- [ ] Salt and pepper
- [ ] 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- [ ] furikake for serving (optional)
- [ ] Sliced green onions, for serving (optional)

### Ingredients for Marinade

- [ ] 1 cup vegetable broth
- [ ] 1 sheet nori
- [ ] 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- [ ] 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- [ ] 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon miso paste
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled
- [ ] 1 teaspoon beet powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)

## Steps

1. Press your tofu. Drain and press your block of tofu for at least 20 minutes.
2. Prep the marinade. While the tofu is pressing, prepare the marinade. Add all the marinade ingredients to a high-speed blender and blend until completely smooth. 
3. Slice the tofu. Once the tofu is well-pressed, cut the block in half lengthwise. Then, turn each piece on its side and cut it in half again. To replicate the shape of a salmon filet, cut the pieces at an angle or with a slight curve. You should have four final strips of tofu. 
4. “Hasselback” the tofu filets. One at a time, take each piece of tofu and lay it flat on a cutting board. Put two chopsticks or butter knives on each side of the piece of tofu. Cut diagonal cuts into the tofu – the chopsticks should stop your knife from cutting all the way through. This will mimic the flaky texture of fish. Repeat with all four filets. 
5. Marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Carefully place the tofu salmon filets in a baking dish and pour the marinade over top. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour or, ideally, overnight.
6. Add nori (optional). If desired, cut strips of nori about the size of each strip of tofu. This resembles the salmon skin. Carefully remove the tofu pieces from the marinade and place on a wire rack or plate. Dip each piece of nori in the leftover marinade and stick on the flat side of each filet.
7. Coat in cornstarch. Carefully coat each tofu filet in cornstarch on the four largest sides. 
8. Pan-fry. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the tofu, nori-side down, to the pan. Depending on the size of your pan, you might have to cook the tofu in two batches.  Cook for about 2 minutes on each of the four sides until crispy. The tofu is delicate and easiest to flip using two spatulas rather than tongs. 
9. Serve. Once crispy on all sides, enjoy immediately while warm!

## Notes

- Good for 3 days in the fridge

- get seaweed in the marinade super fine (or use blender)
- beet powder and tumeric is important for getting the final color
- coat tofu in cornstarch and place immediately into pan. the cornstarch will stick to a plate if you place on an intermediate plate.
- do not worry about coating it with too much cornstarch
- make to sure to press tofu properly to ensure it soaks up marinade
