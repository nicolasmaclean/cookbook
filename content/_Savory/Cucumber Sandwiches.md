For 4 sandwiches

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed
- [ ] 8 slices white bread
- [ ] 4 tablespoons unsalted butter or cream cheese, softened at room temperature
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon ground white or black pepper
- [ ] Optional: watercress, mint leaves, lemon zest, dill, chives, or parsley

## Steps

1. Salt the cucumbers: Line a baking sheet with paper towels and spread the cucumbers on top. Sprinkle lightly with salt and leave for 20 minutes. Pat them dry with more paper towels. Taste the slices, and sprinkle with more salt if they taste bland.
2. Add the spread: Set bread slices on a cutting board and spread one side of each slice generously with butter or cream cheese. You will need about 1-2 teaspoons per slice depending on the size of your bread slices.
3. Arrange the cucumbers on the bread: Overlapping them to cover the bread, lay the cucumbers on half of the bread slices. If the cucumbers are very thin, make 2 layers, if thick, make one. The cucumber filling should be about 1/4-inch thick.
4. Add extra seasoning or ingredients: Sprinkle the cucumber slices with pepper. If you like, top the cucumbers with one of the optional ingredients. Top with a second slice of bread.
5. Cut into small sandwiches: Pressing down firmly, cut the crusts off, and then cut into rectangles, triangles, or quarters. Keep it neat!
6. Serve: Arrange on platters (or a plate) and serve.
