## Steps

### Matcha Cake

1. Preheat oven to 350°F
2. Cream butter and sugar, until light and pale.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the milk, oil and vanilla extract until fully combined.
4. In a separate bowl, sieve together the flour, baking powder and matcha powder. Whisk together until evenly mixed.
5. Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, folding gently together until only just combined.
6. Pour batter into two greased and lined 6 inch cake tins.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes until risen and skewer comes out clean from the middle of the cakes.
8. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 15 minutes then remove from the tins and transfer to a wire rack while you make the ganache.

### White Chocolate Ganache

1. Heat the cream over a double-boiler or in the microwave (15-30 seconds at a time), until hot and steaming but not boiling.
2. Break the chocolate up into small pieces in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream over it. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes and then stir until smooth.
3. Allow the ganache to cool uncovered in fridge for 20-30 minutes until cooled and set.
4. Whip with hand mixer.

### Assembly

1. Once the cake sponges have fully cooled, turn one sponge upside-down and spread roughly ¼ of the ganache evenly in a thick layer on top.
2. Place the other sponge on top to sandwich the layers and cover the top and sides of your cake in the remainder of the ganache.
3. Dust your frosted cake with matcha powder and enjoy!
